# vuln-scan-query

This is a Go-based service that provides a simple API to scan vulnerability `.json` files stored in GitHub repositories and query them by severity.

It is designed to be:
- Fast and concurrent
- Cleanly layered
- Backed by SQLite with deduplication
- Packaged in a single Docker container

---

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- `/scan` endpoint:
  - Accepts a repo and list of `.json` files
  - Fetches files in parallel (3 concurrent workers)
  - Parses each file on the fly
  - Saves unique vulnerabilities to SQLite
  - Retries failed GitHub fetches once

- `/query` endpoint:
  - Accepts a severity filter
  - Returns all stored vulnerabilities with matching severity

- Deduplication based on vulnerability `id` (e.g., CVE-2024-0001)

- Clean Go architecture:
  - Layered: fetcher, service, storage
  - Interfaces for testability
  - 80%+ test coverage on service layer

## ðŸ§ª Testing Instructions

### âœ… Automated Tests

To run unit tests (requires Go â‰¥ 1.24.3):

```bash
go test ./internal/... -cover
```

### âœ… Manual Testing (via Docker)

1. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t vuln-scan-query .
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 vuln-scan-query
```

3. Send a scan request:
   
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/scan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "repo": "velancio/vulnerability_scans",
    "files": ["vulnscan1011.json", "vulnscan1213.json", "vulnscan15.json", "abc.json"]
  }'
```

4. Query stored results:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"filters": {"severity": "CRITICAL"}}'
```
